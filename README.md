# BookRecommender

Book Recommender Project coded in Python
Using collaborative filtering, this code can take in one single book name and return a recommendation based on the 1-million entry dataset from Goodreads reviews of the most popular 100 books.
Also includes a k-fold cross validation test which tests based on the initial dataset. 
Highest accuracy achieved is around 77.76%.

IMPORTANT: Latest working codes are the project7.py, project62.py, and project61.py files, each representing slightly different classifiers.

Utilizes: Python 2.7(csv library)
